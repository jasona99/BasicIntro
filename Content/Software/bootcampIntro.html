Most software necessary for students and faculty work on both Windows and Mac computers. However, Apple provides tools for running Windows on any computer running macOS in the event it becomes necessary.
<br>
Using this service will require obtaining a license for Windows, which may be done on the UVa Software Gateway <a href="http://its.virginia.edu/software/displayPackages.php?tId=32">here</a>. Both Windows 8.1 and 10 are available and will work with Bootcamp, though 10 is recommended.
<br>
Apple provides step-by-step instructions for getting Boot Camp running <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468">here</a>.
<br>
If there are ever any issues with the setup or running this process, feel free to contact the IT Helpdesk.
