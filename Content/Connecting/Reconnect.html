Every year, it is necessary to renew the security certificate that allows you to connect to UVaâ€™s wireless network. Reconnecting is very similar to initial setup.
<br>
To reconnect to the network:
<ol>
  <li>Connect to the "Welcome_to_UVa_Wireless" network</li>
  <li>Run the UVa Network Setup Tool</li>
</ol>
This will renew the certificate and permit you to connect again.
